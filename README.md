# 👁️ Computer Vision: Blink Detection as Morse Code

## 📌 Description

This project uses **computer vision and neural networks** to detect eye blinks and translate them into **Morse code signals**. The goal is to provide an alternative communication interface, especially for people with limited mobility.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV** (Image processing)
- **Mediapipe** (Face and eye detection)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (For improved detection using neural networks)

## 📸 How It Works

1. The camera captures the user's face in real-time.
2. Eyes are detected, and blink tracking is performed.
3. An algorithm measures the duration and frequency of blinks.
4. Short and long blinks are converted into Morse code signals.
5. The message is translated and displayed on the screen.

## 🎯 Applications

- Assistive communication for people with disabilities.
- Contactless interfaces for devices.
- Biometric security and gesture-based control.
